## A simple Firebase demo chat app to talk about all things crypto

Yes, I know that talking about decentralized services web on a centralized service is odd ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### So what is it?
 Demo Firebase app with different chat rooms, where they each talk about a different
 cryptocurrency or project

### Features and Demostration of:
- login, logout
- sign up
- designed with SwiftUI for the frontend
- public chats

### Upcoming Features
- direct messages to users
- send certain crypto to other users wallets(needs more research)

 ### Other notes
 You must import your own Firebase settings(Google-Service.plist) for
 this to compile. Mine are removed for security reasons.
